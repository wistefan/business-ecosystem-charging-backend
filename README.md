# GEi Overal Description

The Business API Ecosystem is a joint component made up of the FIWARE Business Framework and a set of APIs (and its reference implementations) provided by the TMForum. This component allows the monetization of different kind of assets (both digital and physical) during the whole service life cycle, from offering creation to its charging, accounting and revenue settlement and sharing. The Business API Ecosystem exposes its complete functionality through TMForum standard APIs; concretely, it includes the catalog management, ordering management, inventory management, usage management, billing, customer, and party APIs.

In this context, the Business Ecosystem Charging Backend is the component in charge of processing the different pricing models, the accounting information, and the revenue sharing reports. With this information, the  Business Ecosystem Charging Backend is able to calculate amounts to be charged, charge customers, and pay sellers.
